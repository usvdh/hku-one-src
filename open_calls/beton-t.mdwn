Beton-T is Utrecht's experimental city square. A temporary project that transforms unused area into a place where culture, movement, education, greenery, relaxation and wonder can live side by side. Born out of a need for space in a rapidly changing city. You too can organize whatever you want here. From neighborhood barbecue to concert, school tournament to corporate drinks and festival to workshop.
